*** Installation
Clone this repository into your load path.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  git clone https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-clock-export.git
#+end_src
Then:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
  (use-package org-clock-export)
  ;; or
  (require 'org-clock-export)
#+end_src
Or, use this use-package declaration with all custom variables set to the default values:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (use-package org-clock-export
    :config
    (setq org-clock-export-org-ql-query nil
          org-clock-export-files nil
          org-clock-export-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "clock-export.csv")
          org-clock-export-buffer "*ORG-CLOCK-EXPORT CSV*"
          org-clock-export-delimiter ","
          org-clock-export-data-format '("date" (concat start-month "/" start-day "/" start-year)
                                         "hours" total-hours
                                         "minutes" total-minutes
                                         "description" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM")
                                         "hourly rate" (or (org-entry-get (point) "HOURLY-RATE") "325"))))
#+end_src
*** Usage
=org-clock-export-data= does the heavy lifting. You must set this variable yourself. The default value, shown here, is an example.

It is in the style of a plist:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq org-clock-export-data '( "date" (concat start-month "/" start-day "/" start-year)
                                 "hours" total-hours
                                 "minutes" total-minutes
                                 "description" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM")
                                 "hourly rate" (or (org-entry-get (point) "HOURLY-RATE") "325")))
#+end_src

The rules are:

1. The first element is a string to describe the category of data
2. The following sexp is evaluated at each org heading containing a clock line
3. Each sexp can use the following variables, which are bound to values based on each clock-line. The following should be self-explanatory:
  - start-year
  - start-month
  - start-day
  - start-dow [day of week]
  - start-hour
  - start-minute
  - end-year
  - end-month
  - end-day
  - end-dow
  - end-hour
  - end-minute
  - total-hours
  - total-minutes
4. The sexp be any code that will be run at each heading containing a clock line. For example, you can use =org-entry-get= (or any other function) to grab data from the heading and put it into the CSV.
5. The sexp can be a string if you want one field to be constant and not depend on the heading or the clock data. 
6. The only rules for these sexps are that they must return a string, and that they must not move the point (i.e., you should save any excursion).
7. The order of the data in =org-clock-export-data= reflects the order it will appear in the CSV

If you call =org-clock-export= with a prefix (i.e., press =C-u= before calling the command), the csv file will be saved to the location specified by =org-clock-export-file-name=.

If you call it with two prefixes, you will be prompted to select the export file.

*** Example
Consider the following file org file:
#+begin_src org :results silent
  ,* Checking if co-coworker did any work :Gus:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HOURLY-RATE: 250
  :END:
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2021-03-01 Mon 16:40]--[2021-03-01 Mon 16:50] =>  0:10
  CLOCK: [2021-03-01 Mon 15:45]--[2021-03-01 Mon 15:50] =>  0:05
  :END:
  ,* Sending an email to a non-responsive co-worker :email:Gus:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :HOURLY-RATE: 125
  :END:
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2021-03-01 Mon 16:05]--[2021-03-01 Mon 16:17] =>  0:12
  :END:
  ,* Doing the co-coworker’s work for them :Gus:
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2021-03-01 Mon 16:17]--[2021-03-01 Mon 16:30] =>  0:13
  :END:
  ,* Talking about mindless drivel with customer :Abby:
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2021-02-28 Sun 16:19]--[2021-02-28 Sun 17:19] =>  1:00
  :END:
#+end_src
=org-clock-export= will produce the following:
#+begin_example
  date,hours,minutes,description,hourly rate
  03/01/2021,0,10,Checking if co-coworker did any work,250
  03/01/2021,0,05,Checking if co-coworker did any work,250
  03/01/2021,0,12,Sending an email to a non-responsive co-worker,125
  03/01/2021,0,13,Doing the co-coworker’s work for them,325
  02/28/2021,1,00,Talking about mindless drivel with customer,325
#+end_example
A few notes:
1. Note that for the =hourly rate= line, we ensure a string (and not nil) is returned. If a heading does not have an HOURLY-RATE property, =org-entry-get= will return nil. Hence the need to set a default of =325=.
2. If a heading has more than one clock line (here, =Checking if co-coworker did any work=), then the CSV file will contain an entry for /each/ clock line.

*** Restricting exported data
What if you only want to export clock data for certain headings, or for a certain time? Then you use the variable =org-clock-export-org-ql-query=. This will require you to understand how to use =org-ql=. The variable must be a query acceptable to =org-ql-select=. For example, suppose you only wanted to export time entries from headings tagged with =:Abby:=. Then:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(setq org-clock-export-org-ql-query '(tags "Abby"))
#+end_src
And now the output is:
#+begin_example
date,hours,minutes,description,hourly rate
02/28/2021,1,00,Talking about mindless drivel with customer,325
#+end_example
You can use =org-clock-export-org-ql-query= to restrict to certain tags, dates, times, and otherwise harness the full power of =org-ql=. For example, if you only want to export entries for a given date with the tag "Gus", use:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(setq org-clock-export-org-ql-query '(and (clocked :on today) (tags "Gus")))
#+end_src
And you'll get:
#+begin_example
date,hours,minutes,description,hourly rate
03/01/2021,0,10,Checking if co-coworker did any work,250
03/01/2021,0,05,Checking if co-coworker did any work,250
03/01/2021,0,12,Sending an email to a non-responsive co-worker,125
03/01/2021,0,13,Doing the co-coworker’s work for them,325
#+end_example
*** Final example
This should all be pretty easy to follow. If not, here's a final arbitrary example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq org-clock-export-org-ql-query nil)
  (setq org-clock-export-data '( "name" "Jack Jackson"
                                 "date" (concat start-month "/" start-day "/" start-year)
                                 "start time" (concat start-hour ":" start-minute)
                                 "end time" (concat end-hour ":" end-minute)
                                 "total time" (concat total-hours ":" total-minutes)
                                 ;; The headline enclosed in quotes (in case there are commas)
                                 "description" (concat "\"" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM") "\"")
                                 "file name" (buffer-file-name)
                                 "hourly rate" (or (org-entry-get (point) "HOURLY-RATE") "325")))
(org-clock-export)
#+end_src
Results:
#+begin_example
name,date,start time,end time,total time,description,file name,hourly rate

*** Overriding default values
You can override any of the default values by using keywords in the call to =org-clock-export=. The keywords are:
| org-files       |
| org-ql-query    |
| csv-data-format |
| output-file     |
| delimiter       |
| output-buffer   |

If you omit any of the keywords, the default value is used. If you set any of the keywords to nil, then nil is used instead of the default value. Example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (org-clock-export

   ;; Only export anything with a category of "Jones"
   :org-ql-query '(category "Jones")
   :csv-data-format '("matter" (org-entry-get (point) "SOME-PROPERTY" t)
                      ;; I need the date in MM/DD/YYYY format 
                      "date" (concat start-month "/" start-day "/" start-year)
                      ;; Here, I want to remove anything in brackets from the headline text
                      ;; And I need the headline enclosed in quotes in case there is a comma in the text
                      "activity_description" (concat "\"" (s-trim (replace-regexp-in-string "\\[.+\\]" "" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM"))) "\"")
                      "note" (concat "\"" (s-trim (replace-regexp-in-string "\\[.+\\]" "" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM"))) "\"")
                      "price" "425"
                      ;; I need the quantity to the number of hours in decimal form
                      "quantity" (concat total-hours "." (substring (cadr (split-string (format "%f" (/ (string-to-number total-minutes) 60.0)) "\\.")) 0 2))
                      "type" "TimeEntry")
   :output-file "~/path/to/file.csv"
   :delimiter ",")

* A note about escaping characters
Since there is no standard for CSV files, you will need to ensure the strings returned by =org-clock-export-data= are appropriately escaped.
* Other efforts
- org-clock-csv :: https://github.com/atheriel/org-clock-csv. This did not allow me to export my time data in the way I needed and so I wrote this.
