  :type 'string)

(defcustom org-clock-export-export-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "clock-export.csv")
  "File to export data to."
  :type 'file)

(defcustom org-clock-export-delimiter ","
  "Delimiter used in the CSV output. Default: \",\""
  :type 'string)

(defcustom org-clock-export-org-ql-query nil
  "Additional query used by `org-ql-select' to determine which headings to 
check.  For example, if you want to narrow the results to headings tagged with
\"Customer1\" then set this to '(tags \"Customer1\").  See `org-ql' documentation 
for more information.  

All queries are automatically limited to headings with clock lines.  You do not 
need to include '(clocked), however you can add additional limitations, e.g.,
'(clocked :on today)."
  :type 'sexp)

(defcustom org-clock-export-files nil
  "If nil, use `org-agenda-files'.  Otherwise, specify a file
or list of files.  Default: nil."
  :type '(choice file list string))

(defcustom org-clock-export-data-format
  '( "date" (concat start-month "/" start-day "/" start-year)
     "hours" total-hours
     "minutes" total-minutes
     "description" (org-entry-get (point) "ITEM")
     "hourly rate" (or (org-entry-get (point) "HOURLY-RATE") "325"))
  "The following variables are let-bound when the sexps are called, 
based on the values in the clock line:
start-year
start-month
start-day
start-dow
start-hour
start-minute
end-year
end-month
end-day
end-dow
end-hour
end-minute
total-hours
total-minutes
total-time

Any other sexp is evaluated at the first point of each heading with a clock 
line.  Hence, you can use `org-entry-get' to retrieve property values, or any
other method to gather data from the heading.  The only rules are that it must
return a string, and it must keep the point at the heading when finsihed (i.e.,
you should `save-excursion' if you move the point when looking for data.

If there are multiple clock lines in a heading, this returns a line of CSV data
for each one."
